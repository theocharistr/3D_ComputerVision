Calibrate your own camera. Take a 3D box, shot a picture by your camera. Measure the box sizes and read the corresponding pixel coordinates by an image viewer/ image processing tool
like Windows-Paint, Linux Gimp, ImageJ, Photoshop.
Calculate the 3D coordinates of your box corners by using the measured size
